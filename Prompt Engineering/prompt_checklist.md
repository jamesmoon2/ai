# üß© Prompt Checklist Template 

This is a reusable template for designing effective prompts, aligned with your AI Interaction Strategy Framework.

## üß≠ System Prompt (Sets the behavior of the AI)

- [ ] **Persona:**  
  _e.g., "You are an expert AI prompt engineer."_

- [ ] **Tone and Style:**  
  _e.g., formal, casual, bullet points, detailed._

- [ ] **Constraints and Limits:**  
  _e.g., "Keep the answer under 500 words."_

- [ ] **Memory Management:**  
  _e.g., "Remember prior context about project X during this session."_

- [ ] **Ambiguity Handling:**  
  _e.g., "If unclear, ask clarifying questions before answering."_

- [ ] **Fallback Behavior:**  
  _e.g., "If unsure, say 'I am uncertain' and explain why."_

- [ ] **Role Assignments:**  
  _e.g., "Act as both legal advisor and security expert."_

- [ ] **Audience Awareness:**  
  _e.g., "The response should be appropriate for a non-technical executive."_

## üéØ User Prompt (Task-specific input)

- [ ] **Clear Task or Question:**  
  _What specific task or question are you asking?_

- [ ] **Desired Output Format:**  
  _e.g., list, table, Markdown, JSON._

- [ ] **Background and Context:**  
  _Any background information to make the prompt clear._

- [ ] **Clarifying Questions (Optional):**  
  _Prompt the AI: "What else do you need to know?"_

- [ ] **Iteration Request (Optional):**  
  _e.g., "Provide an initial draft, then await feedback."_

- [ ] **Alternative Approaches (Optional):**  
  _e.g., "Offer two alternative solutions and compare them."_

- [ ] **Validation Request (Optional):**  
  _e.g., "Check your answer against the original question."_

- [ ] **Post-Processing Suggestions (Optional):**  
  _e.g., "Suggest next steps after providing the answer."_

## üîÑ Shared Techniques (Advanced prompting tools)

- [ ] **Chain of Thought:**  
  _"Please explain your reasoning step by step."_

- [ ] **Few-Shot Examples:**  
  _Provide example inputs and outputs._

- [ ] **Success Criteria:**  
  _"What does a successful response look like?"_

- [ ] **External Knowledge Use:**  
  _"Assume access to external data sources if needed."_

- [ ] **Error Handling:**  
  _"Flag any uncertainties or risks in your response."_

- [ ] **Multi-Modal Considerations:**  
  _Define if text, images, or other formats are involved._

- [ ] **Prompt Logging:**  
  _Save effective prompts to your library._

- [ ] **Version Tracking:**  
  _Keep track of improvements over time._

## üõ†Ô∏è Engineering Considerations

- [ ] **Execution Context:**  
  _e.g., "Assume a Python 3.10 environment."_

- [ ] **Risk Management:**  
  _"Highlight any high-risk assumptions."_

- [ ] **Stylistic Preferences:**
