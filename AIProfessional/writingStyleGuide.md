# Style Guide for AI Professional Writing

## Voice and Tone

- **Use direct second-person address.** Write directly to the reader using "you" and "your" throughout the text. Example: "You should use AI to identify appropriate design patterns."
- **Adopt an authoritative, instructional tone.** Make definitive statements about best practices rather than hedging. Example: "Select the most capable model available" rather than "You might want to consider selecting a capable model."
- **Maintain a professional, business-oriented voice.** Avoid colloquialisms, slang, or overly casual language.
- **Be assertive but not aggressive.** Use phrases like "You should" rather than "You must" when making recommendations.

## Structure and Organization

- **Begin sections with clear thesis statements** that summarize the key point. Example: "The design phase represents a critical juncture in your development process."
- **Use descriptive section headings** formatted in heading styles to organize content logically.
- **Create concise paragraphs focused on specific points,** typically 3-5 sentences.
- **Start paragraphs with topic sentences** that introduce the main idea.
- **Employ numbered lists for processes** or sequential instructions. Use bullet points sparingly.
- **Include a brief conclusion** that reinforces key points at the end of major sections.

## Sentence Construction

- **Write in active voice** with clear subject-verb relationships.
- **Vary sentence length** but favor medium-length sentences (15-25 words).
- **Create balanced sentences** that aren't overly complex or filled with multiple clauses.
- **Use parallel construction** in lists and series of related items.

## Word Choice and Terminology

- **Employ technical terminology appropriately** without explaining basic concepts.
- **Avoid jargon that might confuse readers** not deeply familiar with AI.
- **Use concrete, specific language** rather than vague generalizations.
- **Select strong, precise verbs** over weak verbs with adverbs.
- **Define specialized terms** when first introducing them, especially in glossary sections.

## Content Approach

- **Focus on practical application** rather than theoretical discussion.
- **Emphasize efficiency and implementation** over conceptual exploration.
- **Provide clear, actionable guidance** that readers can immediately apply.
- **Balance comprehensiveness with conciseness.** Cover topics thoroughly but avoid unnecessary detail.
- **Include examples** to illustrate abstract concepts.
- **Reference specific models and technologies** when relevant (e.g., "Claude 3.7 Sonnet").

## Formatting Conventions

- **Format section titles in Title Case** with clear hierarchy.
- **Use bold text for emphasis** of key concepts or terms.
- **Create visual separation** between major sections with appropriate spacing.
- **Maintain consistent formatting** for similar elements throughout the document.
- **Use numbered sequences** for step-by-step instructions or workflows.

## Instructional Patterns

- **Begin instructional paragraphs with "You should"** to establish a clear directive.
- **Follow the pattern: directive → explanation → example** when introducing new concepts.
- **Structure complex processes as numbered workflows** at the end of relevant sections.
- **Conclude major sections with a summary** reinforcing the importance of the approach.
