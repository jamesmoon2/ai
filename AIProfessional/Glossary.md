# AI Glossary for Newcomers

## A

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Technology that enables computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

**Accessibility Considerations**: Design practices that ensure AI systems and interfaces can be used by people with diverse abilities and disabilities.

**Adversarial Testing**: The process of deliberately attempting to make AI systems fail or produce incorrect outputs to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

**Algorithmic Uncertainty**: The inherent limitations in AI systems that make their outputs probabilistic rather than deterministic, resulting in varying levels of confidence in different predictions.

## B

**Bias**: Systematic errors in AI systems that can result in unfair or discriminatory outcomes, often reflecting biases present in training data or algorithmic design.

**Boilerplate Code**: Standard code sections that can be reused across different projects with minimal changes, which AI can help generate to save development time.

## C

**Chain of Thought (CoT)**: A prompt engineering technique that instructs AI to show step-by-step reasoning to reach a conclusion, improving the quality of complex problem-solving.

**Code Generation**: The use of AI to automatically write code based on specifications or requirements provided by a human.

**Constitutional AI**: An approach to AI development that establishes explicit guidelines for model behavior, often focusing on safety, helpfulness, and harmlessness.

**Context Management**: Techniques for handling the limited context window of AI models, including prioritizing information and maintaining relevant context across interactions.

**Context Window**: The amount of text an AI model can consider at once when generating a response, with larger context windows allowing for more complex interactions.

## D

**Data Analysis**: The process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information and support decision-making, which AI can assist with.

**Data Minimization**: The practice of limiting the amount of sensitive information shared with AI systems to protect privacy.

**Documentation**: Written materials that explain how software works, which AI can help create to improve code maintainability.

## E

**Edge Case Identification**: The process of identifying unusual or extreme scenarios that might cause software to fail, which AI can help with.

**Expert Personas**: A prompt engineering technique where the AI is instructed to respond as if it were a specific type of expert with specialized knowledge.

## F

**Few-Shot Learning**: A technique where AI is provided with a small number of examples to help it understand the desired pattern or response format.

**Form Design**: The creation of user interface elements for collecting input from users, which AI can assist with.

**Frontier Model**:The most advanced AI systems that represent the cutting edge of artificial intelligence technology, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. These models often have tool usage abilities, including the ability to search the web to gather information. 

## H

**Hallucination**: When AI generates information that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect or fabricated, not based on its training data.

## I

**Iterative Refinement**: A development approach where solutions are progressively improved through repeated cycles of improvement, which AI can facilitate.

## L

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**: AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data that can generate human-like text, understand context, answer questions, and perform various language-related tasks.

## M

**Markdown Formatting**: A lightweight markup language used for formatting text documents, often used when requesting structured output from AI.

**Model Selection**: The process of choosing the appropriate AI model for specific tasks based on factors like accuracy, latency, cost, and requirements.

**Multimodal Prompting**: Combining different types of inputs (text, code, diagrams, data) in prompts to enhance AI understanding and response quality.

## P

**Pair Programming**: A software development technique where two programmers work together at one workstation, with AI now able to serve as a partner in this process.

**Persona-Based Prompting**: A technique where AI is instructed to adopt a specific role or perspective when generating responses.

**Prompt Engineering**: The practice of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to AI systems to generate desired outputs, involving techniques like structured formatting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and persona-based instructions.

**Prompt Injection**: A security risk where malicious instructions are embedded in inputs to manipulate AI behavior or bypass safety measures.

## R

**Reasoning Models**: AI models optimized for complex problem-solving, code generation, planning, and situations requiring multi-step logical thinking.

**ReAct Framework**: A prompt engineering approach that combines reasoning and action in iterative steps to solve complex problems.
