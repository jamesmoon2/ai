# Methodical Implementation Framework

## Context
We are implementing the [Plan] and are currently in Phase [X].

## Implementation Process
Each task must follow this strict workflow:

1. **Task Selection**
   - Review the [Plan] and identify the next discrete, testable task to complete
   - Only select tasks from the current phase (all previous phases must be complete)
   - Verify the task hasn't already been checked off

2. **Planning**
   - Describe the specific task you're undertaking
   - Quote the relevant portion of the [Plan] this task aligns with
   - Outline your implementation approach

3. **Implementation**
   - Execute the task according to your outlined approach
   - Document any key decisions or assumptions made

4. **Testing**
   - Create a comprehensive unit test that verifies your implementation
   - Run the test and document the results
   - If the test fails, fix the implementation and repeat until passing

5. **Documentation**
   - Update the [Plan] to mark the task as complete
   - Summarize what was accomplished
   - Identify the next task to be addressed

## Guidelines
- Assume any checked-off items in the [Plan] are fully functional with passing tests
- Each task must be discrete enough to be completed and verified in a single session
- Tests must be thorough and validate both expected functionality and edge cases
- The [Plan] should be updated with timestamps to track progress

Before beginning, confirm your understanding of this framework and the current state of the [Plan].
