## GUIDE OUTLINE

### MODULE 1: INTRODUCTION TO APIS

#### LESSON 1.1: THE "WHY": WHAT IS AN API?

**Core Concepts:**
Imagine you want to order food from a restaurant online. You don't interact directly with the kitchen or the chef. Instead, you use a menu (the interface) to specify your order, and a waiter or a website interface takes that order and communicates it to the kitchen. The kitchen prepares the food, and the waiter brings it back to you.

An API (Application Programming Interface) acts like that menu and waiter. It's a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines *how* software components should interact, specifying the kinds of requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, and the conventions to follow.

APIs are everywhere in modern software:
- Web APIs allow websites to fetch data from servers (like loading tweets on Twitter).
- Operating system APIs allow applications to use hardware features (like saving a file).
- Library APIs allow your code to use functions provided by external code packages.

This guide primarily focuses on **Web APIs**, especially those used for communication between web servers and clients (like browsers or mobile apps).

**Key Points:**
- An API is an interface that allows different software systems to communicate.
- It defines the rules and protocols for interaction.
- Web APIs are crucial for communication between clients and servers on the internet.

**Practice Activity:**
Think about using a weather app on your phone. How do you think the app gets the current weather information? Does it likely contain all weather data itself, or does it use an API? Explain your reasoning.

**(Example Answer):** The app likely uses an API. It would be impractical for the app itself to store and constantly update weather data for every location worldwide. Instead, the app probably sends a request (via an API) to a weather service's server asking for the weather in my current location. The server processes the request and sends back the relevant weather data (e.g., temperature, conditions) via the API, which the app then displays.

**Knowledge Check:**
1. What does API stand for?
2. In the restaurant analogy, what does the API represent?

**(Answers):**
1. Application Programming Interface.
2. The menu and the waiter/website interface â€“ the defined way for the customer (one software component) to interact with the kitchen (another software component).

#### LESSON 1.2: WHY API DESIGN MATTERS

**Core Concepts:**
Just like a poorly designed menu or an inefficient waiter can lead to a frustrating restaurant experience, a poorly designed API can make development difficult, slow, and error-prone for the developers who need to use it (the API consumers).

Good API design is crucial because:
- **Usability:** A well-designed API is intuitive and easy for other developers to understand and use correctly.
- **Maintainability:** A clear and consistent design makes the API easier to maintain, evolve, and debug over time.
- **Scalability & Performance:** Design choices can impact how well the API performs under load and how easily the underlying system can scale.
- **Adoption:** Developers are more likely to use and integrate with APIs that are well-designed and documented.
- **Flexibility:** Good design allows the API to evolve without breaking existing clients unnecessarily.

Designing an API is like designing a user interface, but the "users" are other developers. You need to think about their experience, anticipate their needs, and make common tasks simple and predictable.

**Key Points:**
- API design significantly impacts the developer experience (DX).
- Good design leads to APIs that are easier to use, maintain, and evolve.
- Poor design can hinder adoption and increase development costs.

**Practice Activity:**
Imagine two APIs for getting user information. API A has one simple endpoint `/users/{userId}`. API B requires you to call three different endpoints in sequence, combining the results manually, just to get a user's name and email. Which API offers a better developer experience and why?

**(Example Answer):** API A offers a better experience. It's simpler, more direct, and requires less effort from the developer to achieve the common goal of getting basic user information. API B is complex, inefficient, and error-prone, creating unnecessary work for the developer.

**Knowledge Check:**
1. Who is the primary "user" of an API?
2. List two reasons why good API design is important.

**(Answers):**
1. Other developers (API consumers).
2. Better usability/DX, easier maintenance, improved scalability/performance, higher adoption rates, increased flexibility. (Any two)

### MODULE 2: CORE WEB API CONCEPTS (REST FOCUS)

While there are different styles of web APIs (SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC), many modern APIs follow principles based on **REST (Representational State Transfer)**. We'll focus on concepts common in RESTful APIs.

#### LESSON 2.1: RESOURCES AND ENDPOINTS (URLS)

**Core Concepts:**
REST APIs are typically organized around **Resources**. A resource is any piece of information or entity that the API can provide access to. Think of them as the "nouns" of your API.
- Examples: A User, a Product, an Order, a Tweet, a Photo.

Each resource needs a unique identifier, which in web APIs is a **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**. The specific URL that exposes a resource or a collection of resources is often called an **Endpoint**.

Good endpoint design uses nouns (not verbs) and follows a logical hierarchy:
- `/users` (Represents a collection of all users)
- `/users/{userId}` (Represents a specific user, e.g., `/users/123`)
- `/users/{userId}/orders` (Represents the collection of orders belonging to a specific user)
- `/products` (Represents a collection of products)
- `/products/{productId}` (Represents a specific product)

Avoid using verbs in URLs (like `/getAllUsers` or `/createNewProduct`). The *action* to be performed on the resource is determined by the HTTP method, not the URL itself.

**Key Points:**
- APIs expose functionalities through Resources (nouns).
- Resources are accessed via unique URLs, often called Endpoints.
- Endpoint URLs should use nouns and represent a clear resource hierarchy.
- Avoid verbs in URLs.

**Practice Activity:**
Design potential endpoint URLs for managing blog posts and their comments within an API.

**(Example Answer):**
- `/posts` (Collection of all posts)
- `/posts/{postId}` (A specific post)
- `/posts/{postId}/comments` (Collection of comments for a specific post)
- `/posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}` (A specific comment on a specific post)

**Knowledge Check:**
1. In RESTful API design, what is a Resource?
2. Should API endpoint URLs typically contain verbs or nouns?

**(Answers):**
1. An entity or piece of information the API provides access to (e.g., User, Product).
2. Nouns.

Ready to continue to the next lesson?

#### LESSON 2.2: HTTP METHODS (VERBS)

**Core Concepts:**
If URLs (endpoints) identify the resources (nouns), **HTTP Methods** specify the **action (verb)** you want to perform on that resource.

The most common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:

1.  **GET:** Retrieve a representation of a resource. Used for fetching data. Should be **safe** (calling it multiple times doesn't change the resource) and **idempotent** (multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request).
    *   Example: `GET /users/123` (Retrieve user 123's details)
    *   Example: `GET /users` (Retrieve a list of users)

2.  **POST:** Create a new subordinate resource. Often used to submit data to be processed (e.g., creating a new user based on data sent in the request body). Not necessarily safe or idempotent.
    *   Example: `POST /users` (Create a new user using data in the request body)
    *   Example: `POST /users/123/orders` (Create a new order for user 123)

3.  **PUT:** Replace an existing resource entirely with the data provided in the request body, or create it if it doesn't exist at that specific URL. Should be **idempotent**.
    *   Example: `PUT /users/123` (Replace user 123's entire record with the data in the request body)

4.  **PATCH:** Apply partial modifications to an existing resource. Used to update only specific fields of a resource. Should be **idempotent** (though practical implementation can be tricky).
    *   Example: `PATCH /users/123` (Update only specific fields, e.g., email address, provided in the request body)

5.  **DELETE:** Remove/delete a specific resource. Should be **idempotent**.
    *   Example: `DELETE /users/123` (Delete user 123)

Using these standard methods consistently makes the API predictable.

**Key Points:**
- HTTP methods define the action to perform on a resource.
- GET (Read), POST (Create), PUT (Replace), PATCH (Update), DELETE (Delete).
- Use methods according to their standard semantics (meaning).
- Understand safety and idempotency properties.

**Practice Activity:**
For the blog post API (`/posts`, `/posts/{postId}`), which HTTP method would you use for each action:
1. Get a list of all posts?
2. Create a new blog post?
3. Get the details of post with ID 5?
4. Update the title of post 5?
5. Delete post 5?

**(Example Answer):**
1. `GET /posts`
2. `POST /posts`
3. `GET /posts/5`
4. `PATCH /posts/5` (or `PUT /posts/5` if replacing the whole post)
5. `DELETE /posts/5`

**Knowledge Check:**
1. Which HTTP method is typically used for creating new resources?
2. Which HTTP method is typically used for retrieving data without changing it?

**(Answers):**
1. POST.
2. GET.

Ready to continue to the next lesson?

#### LESSON 2.3: HTTP STATUS CODES

**Core Concepts:**
When a client sends a request to an API endpoint, the server sends back a response. A crucial part of this response is the **HTTP Status Code**, a three-digit number indicating the outcome of the request.

Status codes are grouped into categories:
- **1xx (Informational):** Request received, continuing process (rarely used in APIs).
- **2xx (Successful):** The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
    *   `200 OK`: Standard success response for GET, PUT, PATCH.
    *   `201 Created`: The request was successful, and a new resource was created (often used for POST). The response usually includes a `Location` header pointing to the new resource's URL.
    *   `204 No Content`: The request was successful, but there's no data to return (often used for DELETE or successful updates with no body needed).
- **3xx (Redirection):** Further action needs to be taken by the client to complete the request (e.g., `301 Moved Permanently`).
- **4xx (Client Error):** The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled. The client seems to have erred.
    *   `400 Bad Request`: Generic client error (e.g., invalid JSON, missing required fields).
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: Client lacks valid authentication credentials.
    *   `403 Forbidden`: Client is authenticated, but doesn't have permission to access the resource.
    *   `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
    *   `405 Method Not Allowed`: The HTTP method used (e.g., GET) is not supported for the requested resource (e.g., trying to GET a resource that only supports POST).
    *   `429 Too Many Requests`: Client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting).
- **5xx (Server Error):** The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic error message when an unexpected condition was encountered on the server.
    *   `503 Service Unavailable`: The server is not ready to handle the request (e.g., down for maintenance or overloaded).

Using appropriate status codes makes the API's response clear and allows clients to handle outcomes programmatically.

**Key Points:**
- HTTP status codes indicate the result of an API request.
- 2xx = Success, 4xx = Client Error, 5xx = Server Error.
- Use specific status codes accurately (e.g., `201` for creation, `404` for not found).

**Practice Activity:**
What status code would you expect an API to return for these scenarios?
1. Successfully deleting a user (`DELETE /users/123`)?
2. Trying to get details for a user that doesn't exist (`GET /users/999`)?
3. Successfully creating a new product (`POST /products`)?
4. Trying to access an admin-only endpoint without logging in (`GET /admin/stats`)?

**(Example Answer):**
1. `204 No Content` (or maybe `200 OK` if returning a confirmation message)
2. `404 Not Found`
3. `201 Created`
4. `401 Unauthorized` (or `403 Forbidden` if authentication exists but lacks admin rights)

**Knowledge Check:**
1. What category of status codes indicates a client-side error?
2. What status code is typically used to indicate successful resource creation?

**(Answers):**
1. 4xx.
2. `201 Created`.

#### LESSON 2.4: DATA FORMATS (JSON)

**Core Concepts:**
APIs need a standard way to structure the data sent in request bodies (for POST, PUT, PATCH) and response bodies (often for GET).

While older APIs sometimes used XML, the dominant data format for modern web APIs is **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**.

JSON is:
- **Text-based:** Easy for humans to read and write.
- **Lightweight:** Less verbose than XML.
- **Language-independent:** Supported by virtually all programming languages.
- **Structured:** Uses key-value pairs (objects/dictionaries) and ordered lists (arrays).

Example JSON representing a user:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "username": "jdoe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "isActive": true,
  "roles": ["user", "editor"]
}
```

APIs should:
- Clearly specify that they expect and return JSON using the `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP header in requests and responses.
- Use consistent naming conventions for keys (e.g., `camelCase` or `snake_case`, just pick one and stick to it).
- Structure data logically.

**Key Points:**
- JSON is the de facto standard data format for modern web APIs.
- It's human-readable, lightweight, and widely supported.
- Use the `Content-Type` header to indicate JSON data.
- Maintain consistency in naming and structure.

**Practice Activity:**
Represent a simple blog post with an ID, title, content body, and a list of tags using JSON format.

**(Example Answer):**
```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "title": "My First Blog Post",
  "body": "This is the content of the blog post.",
  "tags": ["tech", "intro", "blogging"]
}
```

**Knowledge Check:**
1. What does JSON stand for?
2. What HTTP header is used to specify that the request or response body contains JSON data?

**(Answers):**
1. JavaScript Object Notation.
2. `Content-Type: application/json`.

### MODULE 3: API DESIGN PRINCIPLES

#### LESSON 3.1: CONSISTENCY

**Core Concepts:**
Consistency is perhaps the most important principle in API design. An API should feel predictable and coherent.

Apply consistency in:
- **Naming:** Use the same conventions for URLs, query parameters, and JSON fields (e.g., always `camelCase`, always plural nouns for collections).
- **Resource Representation:** Similar resources should have similar structures.
- **Error Handling:** Return errors in a consistent format, providing useful information.
- **HTTP Methods & Status Codes:** Use standard methods and codes correctly and predictably across all endpoints.
- **Pagination & Filtering:** Implement these features consistently for collection endpoints.
- **Authentication/Authorization:** Use the same mechanism across the entire API.

A consistent API is easier to learn and use, reducing cognitive load for developers.

**Key Points:**
- APIs should be consistent in naming, structure, behavior, and error handling.
- Consistency makes the API predictable and easier to learn.

**Practice Activity:**
If an API uses `/users/{userId}` and `/products/{productId}`, what would be the consistent URL pattern for retrieving a specific order?

**(Example Answer):** `/orders/{orderId}`

**Knowledge Check:**
1. Give two areas where consistency is important in API design.

**(Answers):**
1. Naming conventions, resource representation, error handling, HTTP method/status code usage, pagination/filtering, authentication. (Any two)

Ready to continue to the next lesson?

#### LESSON 3.2: DOCUMENTATION

**Core Concepts:**
An API without documentation is like a product without instructions â€“ developers won't know how to use it effectively.

Good API documentation should cover:
- **Authentication:** How to authenticate requests.
- **Endpoints:** List all available endpoints, their URLs, and supported HTTP methods.
- **Request/Response Details:** For each endpoint/method:
    - Required parameters (path, query, header).
    - Expected request body format (with examples).
    - Possible response status codes and their meanings.
    - Response body format for successful requests (with examples).
    - Example error response formats.
- **Concepts:** Explanation of core resources and business logic.
- **Examples:** Practical code examples in various languages can be very helpful.
- **Tutorials/Guides:** Walkthroughs for common use cases.

Tools like **Swagger/OpenAPI Specification** allow you to define your API structure in a machine-readable format, which can then be used to automatically generate interactive documentation, client SDKs, and server stubs.

**Key Points:**
- Documentation is essential for API usability.
- It should clearly explain authentication, endpoints, request/response formats, and provide examples.
- Standards like OpenAPI can automate documentation generation.

**Practice Activity:**
Why is simply listing the endpoint URLs not enough for good API documentation?

**(Example Answer):** Just listing URLs doesn't tell the developer *how* to use the endpoint: which HTTP method to use, what parameters are needed, what data format to send in the request body, what status codes to expect, or what the response data will look like. Good documentation needs all these details.

**Knowledge Check:**
1. Besides listing endpoints, what are two other crucial things API documentation should include?

**(Answers):**
1. Authentication details, request parameters, request body format, response status codes, response body format, error formats, examples, core concepts. (Any two)

Ready to continue to the next lesson?

#### LESSON 3.3: VERSIONING

**Core Concepts:**
APIs evolve over time. New features are added, existing ones might change, and sometimes breaking changes are necessary (changes that would cause existing client applications to stop working correctly).

To manage these changes without disrupting existing users, APIs should be **versioned**. Versioning allows you to release new iterations of your API while maintaining older versions for clients who haven't updated yet.

Common versioning strategies:
1.  **URI Versioning:** Include the version number directly in the URL path (most common).
    *   Example: `/v1/users`, `/v2/users`
2.  **Query Parameter Versioning:** Include the version as a query parameter.
    *   Example: `/users?version=1`, `/users?api-version=2`
3.  **Custom Header Versioning:** Include the version in a custom HTTP header.
    *   Example: `Accept-Version: v1`, `X-API-Version: 2`
4.  **Media Type Versioning (Accept Header):** Use the standard `Accept` header to specify the version via a custom media type.
    *   Example: `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`

URI versioning is often preferred for its simplicity and visibility. Regardless of the method, have a clear strategy for when and how to introduce new versions and when to deprecate old ones.

**Key Points:**
- Versioning allows APIs to evolve without breaking existing clients.
- Common strategies include putting the version in the URI, query parameter, or headers.
- Have a clear deprecation policy for older versions.

**Practice Activity:**
An API currently uses `/products` and `/orders`. The team needs to make a breaking change to how orders are structured. Using URI versioning, what would the new endpoint for orders likely be, and what happens to the old one?

**(Example Answer):** The new endpoint would likely be `/v2/orders`. The old `/v1/orders` (or simply `/orders` if it was the implicit v1) would be kept running for a period to support older clients, but eventually deprecated and removed according to the API's policy.

**Knowledge Check:**
1. Why is versioning important for APIs?
2. What is the most common method for API versioning?

**(Answers):**
1. To allow the API to evolve and introduce potentially breaking changes without disrupting existing clients who rely on older versions.
2. URI Versioning (putting the version number in the URL path, e.g., `/v1/...`).

### FINAL CONCEPTUAL SCENARIO

Imagine you are designing a simple Web API for a library system. The API needs to allow users (librarians or patrons) to manage books and authors.

**Task:** Outline the basic design for this API, considering:
1.  **Resources:** What are the main resources?
2.  **Endpoints:** Suggest some key endpoint URLs for these resources.
3.  **Methods:** For one or two endpoints, list the appropriate HTTP methods and their purpose.
4.  **Status Codes:** Mention a few key status codes you'd expect to use.
5.  **Versioning:** How might you handle versioning?

**(Example Solution Outline):**

1.  **Resources:** `Book`, `Author`.
2.  **Endpoints:**
    *   `/v1/books` (Collection of books)
    *   `/v1/books/{bookId}` (A specific book)
    *   `/v1/authors` (Collection of authors)
    *   `/v1/authors/{authorId}` (A specific author)
    *   `/v1/authors/{authorId}/books` (Collection of books by a specific author)
3.  **Methods (Example: `/v1/books`)**
    *   `GET /v1/books`: Retrieve a list of all books (potentially with filtering/pagination).
    *   `POST /v1/books`: Create a new book (data in request body).
    **Methods (Example: `/v1/books/{bookId}`)**
    *   `GET /v1/books/{bookId}`: Retrieve details of a specific book.
    *   `PUT /v1/books/{bookId}`: Replace the entire book record.
    *   `PATCH /v1/books/{bookId}`: Partially update the book record.
    *   `DELETE /v1/books/{bookId}`: Delete the book.
4.  **Status Codes:**
    *   `200 OK` (Successful GET, PUT, PATCH)
    *   `201 Created` (Successful POST)
    *   `204 No Content` (Successful DELETE)
    *   `400 Bad Request` (Invalid input data)
    *   `401 Unauthorized` / `403 Forbidden` (Auth errors)
    *   `404 Not Found` (Book or Author doesn't exist)
    *   `500 Internal Server Error` (Server issues)
5.  **Versioning:** Using URI path versioning (`/v1/`). Future breaking changes would go into `/v2/`. Non-breaking changes can be added to `/v1/`. JSON would be the data format (`Content-Type: application/json`). Documentation (e.g., OpenAPI) would be crucial.
