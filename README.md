# This is a working playbook for getting better at using AI.

I’m James Mooney, and I’ve spent a lot of time testing how foundation models behave in the real world — what works, what fails, and how to get useful output without wasting time. These notes are the product of that process.

You’ll find frameworks for structuring prompts, patterns for building AI-driven workflows, and examples that move beyond theory into practice. No fluff, no empty predictions. Just tactics that hold up when you actually put them to use.

This is as much for me as it is for anyone else. I use this space to sharpen my own thinking, track lessons learned, and keep evolving as the tools improve. If it helps you along the way, even better.

It’s a living document. Expect updates, revisions, and the occasional dead end. Good ideas survive pressure; weak ones don’t. Contributions and challenges are welcome.

If you’re looking for shortcuts, you won’t find them here. But if you’re looking to work smarter with AI — and think a little sharper along the way — you’re in the right place.
