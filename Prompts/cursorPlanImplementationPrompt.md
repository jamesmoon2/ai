We are now moving ahead with the attached [PLAN] plan. Here is how this is going to work. You must review the [PLAN]and tell me what work you are going to accomplish. All phases must be completed before a new phase can begin. It must be a discrete task that you can then cross off the list in the [PLAN]. Your task must be testable and you must create a unit test to prove the work you completed was done completely and correctly.  If you see something checked off in the plan, you should assume itâ€™s working and all unit tests have been completed. First, you must share your plan with me along with the portion of the @[PLAN] it aligns with. Then you must complete the change. Following which, you must prepare and run a unit test. After than, you will update the [PLAN]. We will follow this process until the [PLAN] is fully implemented. Is your task and the workflow you must follow to accomplish it clear?
